**IPEM Plus** is an ESP32-C5 (2.4GHz and 5GHz) based IoT Power Mains Energy Monitor Board SDK with LoRa LoRaWAN (850 MHz through to 930 MHz)

The **IPEM Plus** board is designed to fit a DIN Enclosure, complete with optional Panel Display.  This enables the complete monitor to be mounted with an rack enclosure or cabinet, if required.

The **IPEM Plus** board maybe also mounted within a standard enclosure, without the DIN option.

**NEW SDK BOARD** - Availability planned for April 2026.

## History

The popular IPEM Series of Mains Energy Monitors started with the [IPEM](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEM-IoT-Power-Energy-Monitor), which was an ESP32 based board and later the [IPEM PiHat](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEM-PiHat-IoT-Power-Energy-Monitor), designed to interface to a Pi.

These boards are used around the World and in so many project, from home, businesses, industry to Farming and Agriculture.

Due to some obsolescence on some minor components, the IPEM board was required to be updated.   

The enormous interest in  my recent LoRa range, such as the [ESPRanger](https://github.com/DitroniX/ESPRanger-LoRa-GNSS-GPS-IMU-RS485-60V) and [ESPKnack](https://github.com/DitroniX/ESPKnack-LoRa-Isolated-I-Os-RS485-5-60V-4-20mA-Relays-DIN) showed that rather than just tweak the original IPEM, it could be updated to offer a number of new features, and LoRa is just one of them.

The new IPEM Plus board follows the design route of the new [ESPKnack](https://github.com/DitroniX/ESPKnack-LoRa-Isolated-I-Os-RS485-5-60V-4-20mA-Relays-DIN), so remains compact but allows for it to also be also optionally DIN mounted, using the DIN Enclosure.

In addition, I have moved away from the ESP32-C6, in favour for the ESP32-C5, so allowing the same radio features that the C6 provides but also 5 GHz WiFi.  This opens up a range of new and exciting projects, especially in industry, where 5 GHz could be deployed in noisy environments.

For those of you that do not require LoRa, but do require features of the original IPEM, the **IPEM Plus** will contiunue to provide this continuity and more.  Thus is will be the enhanced replacement for IPEM E32 and E36.

A full subset of the **IPEM Plus** will be updated shorty.

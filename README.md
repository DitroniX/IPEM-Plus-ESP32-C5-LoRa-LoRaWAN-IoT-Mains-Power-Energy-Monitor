**Supporting STEM Electronic Internet of Things & Home Automation Technology for Smart Energy Monitoring**

**IPEM Plus** is an ESP32-C5 (2.4Ghz and 5GHz) based IoT Power Mains Energy Monitor Board SDK with LoRa LoRaWAN

The **IPEM Plus** board is designed to fit a DIN Enclosure, complete with optional Panel Display.  This enables the complete monitor to be mounted with an rack enclosure or cabinet, if required.

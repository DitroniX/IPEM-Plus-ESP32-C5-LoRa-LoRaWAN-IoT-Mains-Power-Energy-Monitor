**IPEM Plus** is an ESP32-C5 (2.4GHz and 5GHz) based IoT Power Mains Energy Monitor Board SDK with LoRa LoRaWAN (850 MHz through to 930 MHz)

The **IPEM Plus** board is designed to fit a DIN Enclosure, complete with optional Panel Display.  This enables the complete monitor to be mounted with an rack enclosure or cabinet, if required.

The **IPEM Plus** board maybe also mounted within a standard enclosure, without the DIN option.
